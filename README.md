# Automatic-Temperature-Controller
This is the software side to an crystallization machine that I help make over the summer.
It's able to automatically control the temperature of a Peltier and I used it to make crystals 
but I truly belive it can be used for anything.

The crystallization machine was simply designed to automatically make crystals and how it did that was 
by allowing the user to program a increase or decrease to the temperature of the peltier after a certain amount of time. 
Also It has the capability to automatically save pictures of the sample to the computer after a certain amount of time.
So for example the user can program the algorithm to have screenshots of the sample be saved to the computer every 30 minutes.

I'm still working on uploading all the instructions
